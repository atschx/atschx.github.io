> Apple Push Notification service (APNs for short) is the centerpiece of the remote notifications feature. It is a robust and highly efficient service for propagating information to iOS and OS X devices. Each device establishes an accredited and encrypted IP connection with the service and receives notifications over this persistent connection. If a notification for an app arrives when that app is not running, the device alerts the user that the app has data waiting for it.
