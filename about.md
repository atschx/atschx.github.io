> For what it's worth, it's never too late, or in my case, too early, to be whoever you want to be.

> There's no time limit, stop whenever you want.

> You can change or stay the same.

> There's no rules to this thing.

> We can make the best or the worst of it.

> I hope you make the best of it.

> I hope you see things that startle you.

> I hope you feel things you never felt before.
